            “We strive to design things that serve our clients, without reducing
            the end-user to 'data-prey'. With the effort on our part to
            understand what is of unique value in a product or service, it
            becomes easier to find that elusive middle ground.”

            demands of the format. There is a fine balance to be had between
            style and content. Engaging the imagination of a person is
            important, while avoiding the traps of outdated, deceptive ad
            strategies.”

            ... was founded in 2020 by Lars and Sven Lundgren, two brothers who
            went into business together. We build sites and apps that are handy,
            look good and are easy to use. While our clients have included some
            big names like Virgin, the Government of North Korea and the NYC
            Transit Authority, we also work with smaller clients. Some of our
            favourite projects have been our local school's website as well as
            an app (you've probably heard of 'Claws') for a nation-wide cat
            shelter network.
