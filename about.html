            ...we build sites and apps that are informative, look good and are
            enjoyable to use. The company was founded in 2020 by Lars and Sven
            Lundgren, two brothers who went into business together. While our
            clients have included names like 360 Org, the Union of Concerned
            Scientists and the NYC Transit Authority, we also work with smaller
            clients. Some of our favourite projects have been our local school's
            website as well as an app (you've probably heard of 'Claws') for a
            nationwide cat shelter network.
