            The Electrophile Computational Company was founded by Lars and Sven Lundgren, two brothers who wanted to do something different. We are a small company that emphasises creative, elegant and practical approaches.  Our work is tailored to explore and make the most out of each new client relationship. We build sites and web apps that are handy, look good and easy to use. While our clients have included some big names like Apple and the New York Transit Authority, we also work with smaller clients. Some of our favourite projects have been our local school's website as well as an app for the neighbourhood cat shelter!
