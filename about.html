            memorable for the end user. While the artistic component is always
            important, our clients specific needs set the foundation. Every
            project becomes a learning experience.”

            The Electrophile Computational Company was founded by Lars and Sven
            Lundgren, two brothers who wanted to do something different. We are
            a small company that emphasises creative, elegant and practical
            approaches. Our work is tailored to explore and make the most out of
            each new client relationship. We build sites and web apps that are
            handy, look good and easy to use. While our clients have included
            some big names like Apple and the New York Transit Authority, we
            also work with smaller clients. Some of our favourite projects have
            been our local school's website as well as an app for the
            neighbourhood cat shelter!
