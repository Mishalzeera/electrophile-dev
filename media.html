                        ‘The office of Sven Lundgren is a small oasis of mess in the spacious, minimalist offices of the Electrophile Computational Company in Haarlem, Holland. The Swedish co-owner (along with his younger brother Lars) has been making a name for himself in the design world. <br><br>
Recently, it seems that Electrophile has been in every blog and design publication you look at. “I know, its bizarre.” says Sven. “I never set out to do anything other than have a side income freelancing with Lars. It all happened so quickly, going from the two of us to 80 employees.” He pauses to think. “Really, it was mostly for Lars to pay off his student loans!” <br><br>
When asked about his minimalist philosophy in design, he seems perplexed. “We aren’t the only people advocating simplicity. We aren’t even always simple, it just seems to be the best solution for most people we meet. Im a bit surprised at the reaction.” <br><br>
He pours me a cup of strong coffee in an IKEA cup, and looks embarrassed when I ask him if he shops there. Apparently, yes, he does, but just for basics. There is one conveniently located in Haarlem, he adds,  where he can buy some of his favourite Swedish fish paste from the food section. “I don’t drive a Volvo though.” <br><br>
It was during Apple’s launch for the iPhone 13 when his younger brother made a (slightly inebriated) off the cuff speech to the press that went viral. A massive 400k views per hour brought the topic of bloated, overly functional design to many a table. Sven, again looking embarrassed, holds forth. <br><br>
“Im still not sure if I am glad about that or not. He really had too much to drink and shouldn’t have been so specific about the Public Storage website.” He grimaces.
Oh yes, <em>that</em> very public design war…’
