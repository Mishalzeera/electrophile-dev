              The office of Sven Lundgren is a small oasis of mess in the
              spacious, uncluttered offices of the Electrophile Computational
              Company in Haarlem, Holland. The Swedish co-owner (along with his
              younger brother Lars) has been making a name for himself in the
              design world. Bauhaus, Willam Morris and the Dada Movement are
              once again household names, seemingly down to the Lundgren
              brothers.<br /><br />
              Recently, Electrophile has been in every blog and design
              publication you look at. “I know, its bizarre.” says Sven. “I
              never set out to do anything other than have a side income
              freelancing with Lars. It all happened so quickly, going from the
              two of us to 80 employees.” He pauses to think. “Really, it was
              mostly for Lars to pay off his student loans! He was never good
              with small details like monthly finances.” <br /><br />

              He pours me a cup of strong coffee in an IKEA cup, and looks
              embarrassed when I ask him if he shops there. Apparently, yes, he
              does, but just for basics. There is one conveniently located in
              Haarlem, he adds, where he can buy some of his Swedish fish paste
              from the food section. “I don’t drive a Volvo though.”
              <br /><br />
              It was during Apple’s launch for the iPhone 13 when his younger
              brother made a (slightly inebriated) off the cuff speech to the
              press that went viral. A massive 400k views per hour brought the
              topic of bloated, overly functional design to many a table. Sven,
              again, looks embarrassed.<br /><br />
              “Im still not sure if I am glad about that or not. He really had
              too much to drink and shouldn’t have been so specific about the
              Public Storage website.” He grimaces. Oh yes, <em>that</em> very
              public design war…<br />
