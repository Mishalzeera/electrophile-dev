# The Electrophile Computational Company

## **Purpose**

This is a website to inform the public about a web-design/web-app dev company.

The skillset of the company includes copywriting as well as graphic design.

The impression given to the customer should be that we have a particular set of skills as well as a design-based orientation.

The playful, graphical character of the company should be evident on the site. The viewer should be able to have a sense immediately if we are of a similar mindset.

## **Features**

### Home page

<br>

![First page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/1stpage.png)

- Home page (and consistent elements)

  - High contrast text (from left on desktop view, top on mobile view) informs you about our services, has a "call to action" section with a button, and a high value testimonial.
  - Sets the tone with grey backgrounds, header and footer and even body in lighter shades of grey. Strong contrast with colourful, playful imagery and button colour.
  - A responsive navigation area that clearly shows where the user is, using active classes. Also allows for a little bit of font variety, without distracting from the main Roboto family.
  - The footer, with its barcode styling, allows for some further visual indication of our design sensibilites.

### Projects (About Us) page

<br>

![Second page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/2ndpage.png)

- Projects page (updated to About Us page)

  - Page with an image in one row, then two sections in another, in desktop mode.
  - The left section, about 30% of the screen, contains text that describes notable completed projects. Written from the perspective staff developers, designers and copywriters, it should project our particular skillset.
  - The right section will have an embedded video that documents a project that shows our company values and intentions. This would be a project that involves our work being part of a greater social effort. Ideally, this would add some greater scope to our company profile.

### **Media page**

<br>

![Third page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/3rdpage.png)

- Media page

  - A page it is hoped that a visitor would spend some time on. The goal is not to overwhelm but to entertain while informing.
  - Layout wise, on desktop - half the screen will be video media. The remaining area on the right is split between an image element and an aside bar.
  - The videos should be short clips from design blogs and branding tutorials we have contributed to. Interspersed with that, some irreverent homemade entertainment.
  - The aside bar is a list of quotes from linked articles. (update: The aside bar will be an embedded article about our company linked from a prominent tech journal)

### **Contact page**

<br>

![Fourth page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/4thpage.png)

- Contact page

  - Layout with one third containing phone numbers, addresses and social links. Two thirds of the screen on the right is a contact form.
  - Spacious, grounded and inviting using line-height, contrast, white space and visual heirarchy.

## First Build

After building the site and getting it responsive-ish - it became clear that the Projects page needed to be an About Us page instead. It didn't seem effective to launch into specifics at that point.

### Things I could do better next time

Despite my intention being to build a mobile first site, I built the desktop view first. I regretted that as I felt my code was less compact than it could have been. Also the heirarchical structures of Flexbox is so much more intuitive when mobile-first. At least, it seems to me at this early point in my learning. I am considering whether to rebuild the site in that way, on a different branch and then compare later. (Update, lesson learned - its a total mess trying to reverse it. Not worth the time.)

### External video sizing issue

The most stubborn detail I have at this stage is getting the video player to behave naturally. It wants specific widths and heights, and doesn't want to flow along with the rest of the content.

The solution is to create a wrapper class with a position of relative, then position the iframe element as absolute. Top0 Left0 Width100% but most importantly, a padding-top of 56.25% which precisely constrains the default 16:9 Youtube video proportions.

## Second Build

After living with the content for a week, the purpose of the site and the approach to the content became clear. Previously I had been operating on a mental level. Things became cohesive and instinctual when I decided that an Edison bulb should be the central visual focus of my site. Adding textual content also provided a sense of direction that I needed for this project. I can see very easily how important it is to have clients who know what they want. Without that clarity, something is always missing.

A totally dark landing page with a b/w bulb that turns on when you click it gets you into the main page of the site. I liked that feeling of interactivity along with the cohesion of the company purpose.

## Thoughts after my mentor session

Finally I had some feedback on what I was doing, which immediately clarified many things for me. Other than some margin issues, technically the site was in working shape. However, the need for simplifying things became apparent as we discussed the site. I became aware of the mental impression I had that there has to be a lot of "stuff" in order for it to be a proper website.

I got a good sense of which design choices I made that were good, and which were not good. A sense of narrowing down the vision for the site took place, and now as I begin to revise the site I feel clear about what I need to do.

**Some examples of the clutter**

I was convinced I needed lots of video media, but my mentor assured me that a company like the one I am pretending to own wouldn't do things that way.

![Way too much stuff](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/2media-page.png)

Already the messy Youtube functionality distracts and impedes the visual flow. I will limit the video media to a single one, and will try Vivo or Vimeo since I find the Youtube styling ugly.

**Looking at my peers work**

On the Slack channel there were a few really good examples that inspired me to commit further to the visual elements that I like for my site. In particular, Daphne Heimgartners "Follow The Moon" page, at https://daph1986.github.io/Follow-the-moon/ - really helped it click for my way of thinking.

I am learning that the images, colours and fonts should be allowed to have all they need to speak clearly, and keep the text content to the necessary function. The text content and visuals should work in harmony, guiding the end user to whatever desired action while informing them on deeper levels what the site owners creative values are.
