# The Electrophile Computational Company

## Purpose

This is a website to inform the public about a web/web-app dev company. 

The skillset of the company includes copywriting as well as graphic design. 

The impression given to the customer should be that we, the company, are interested in our clients backgrounds and unique qualities. Instead of adopting the same approach every time, our service becomes an extension of their best vision.

The playful, graphical character of the company should be evident on the site. The viewer should be able to have a sense immediately if we are of a similar mindset. 

## __Features__

### __Home page__
<br>

- __Home page (and consistent elements)__ 


     - High contrast text (from left on desktop view, top on mobile view) informs you about our services, has a "call to action" section with a button, and a high value testimonial. 
     - Sets the tone with grey backgrounds, header and footer and even body in lighter shades of grey. Strong contrast with colourful, playful imagery and button colour.
     - A responsive navigation area that clearly shows where the user is, using active classes. Also allows for a little bit of font variety, without distracting from the main Roboto family.
     - The footer, with its barcode styling, allows for some further visual indication of our design sensibilites.

### __Projects page__
<br>

- __Projects page__

    - Page with an image in one row, then two sections in another, in desktop mode. 
    - The left section, about 30% of the screen, contains text that describes notable completed projects. Written from the perspective staff developers, designers and copywriters, it should project our particular skillset.
    - The right section will have an embedded video that documents a project that shows our company values and intentions. This would be a project that involves our work being part of a greater social effort. Ideally, this would add some greater scope to our company profile, and counteract any mercinary impression.

### __Media page__

<br>

![Third page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/3rdpage.png)

- __Media page__

    - A page it is hoped that a visitor would spend some time on. The goal is not to overwhelm but to entertain while informing.
    - Layout wise, on desktop - half the screen will be video media. The remaining area on the right is split between an image element and an aside bar.
    - The videos should be short clips from design blogs and branding tutorials we have contributed to. Interspersed with that, some irreverent homemade entertainment. 
    - The aside bar is a list of quotes from linked articles.

![Fourth page](assets/imgs/wframe-imgs/4thpage.png)

- __Contact page__

    - Layout with one third containing phone numbers, addresses and social links. Two thirds of the screen on the right is a contact form.
    - Spacious, grounded and inviting using line-height, contrast, white space and visual heirarchy.
