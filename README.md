# **The Electrophile Computational Company**

A website for a fictitious web and app development company. The company has a copywriting and design-first orientation, which is geared towards a clientele with a specific mentality. The client has an entrepreneurial spirit but has an aversion to business-speak-catchphrases. No "implementing strategic deployments using the emerging third world labour market" or indeed, ever using the word "deployment", in any context.

She or he has an innate sense of respect for their customers and, while being ambitious, is not specifically motivated by financial incentives. This is the type of business owner who would run on a sustainable model and the sort of person who - beyond their basic needs and a holiday here and there - isn't out to climb any financial rungs.

Think of [Martin Shkreli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli). Now imagine his total opposite. Our client may indeed have a lot of financial and social clout, and be respected in their field. In any case, he or she would have earned their position through their interpersonal skills and their ability to make the correct judgment of situations and people.

The website is intended to serve as a manifesto of sorts, without being heavy-handed in the way this README is already(!).

I imagine this website to be seen by a potential client after a casual social meeting, probably by chance. "Oh, you make websites and apps for people like me? What do you mean by people like me?" "Here let me send you our site." and then upon first glance there is already a sense of connection or not. It's not intended to necessarily draw in people from the web via links but that sort of functionality is present and prominent. A contact page and a few CTA buttons on the main page cater to that situation. The primary client would already have an Electrophile employee's phone number in their mobile, though.

## The evolution of the site

If you refer to first_README.md you can chart my progress more closely. I found it difficult to have any real sense of how to design the site until the company vision, fictitious or not, became clear. It reminded me of my experiences as a freelance audio professional - the most difficult jobs are the ones where the client doesn't know what they want. In the early wireframes, you might get a sense of messing around in the shallow waters. Some of the colour schemes and font ideas did indeed survive, but the intent and purpose have changed totally.

The genesis of the site was in a conversation with my previous mentor. While she was clearly capable and had some good advice for me initially, we had to part ways due to scheduling obstacles and some communication problems. I had initially built a site for my audio services, which I approached in an unorthodox way. I used background images and audio players as the main content. She immediately began picking at issues of contrast and visibility - which were the elements I liked the most. It's a dark, moody website that I want people to spend some time relaxing in. Listen to the music, allow an atmosphere to form.

That is not for everybody and a pretty bad idea for a Code Institute Milestone Project. I can imagine that there are certain concepts you want to be sure that a student grasps - design and structural concepts. Moreover, it being representative of my musical work, I was perhaps too sensitive to any suggestions I didn't like regarding it.

I then thought, why not build a site I can later adapt to my own needs? I have the intention to freelance as a web developer as soon as I am able. A quick Google search of interesting scientific terms yielded the word "electrophile" which I liked.

**First mentor meeting**

Furthermore, at this point, I got in contact with Brian Macharia, my replacement mentor. His feedback was based on objective design principles as well as his experience in mentoring previous CI students. It was, in fact, his off the cuff remark that my ultra-sparse redirect.html page was his favourite that gave me the best sense of how to proceed.

I then really homed in on the bulb image as a central theme for the site. A solitary dark bulb is the index page, and every bulb is a link to the next page.

**Second mentor meeting**

By this point, despite having enjoyed the process of taking the site to its 90% state, I was ready to move on. I had been dabbling in the Javascript and JQuery sections of the CI course and was getting very wrapped up in it. Brian had more good feedback for me, specific points that I could write up in a checklist and get through in a single morning.

## What I learned

There were many stages I particularly enjoyed - working on the images and the text content especially. Web design is easier with strong image, font and content cohesion, I think. Some of the most useful steps in my process involved taking my time choosing the right visual elements.

The areas that I felt the most challenged by were positioning things in CSS, as well as strategising layout and styling decisions to be in harmony with one another.

Redundant class names, poor class naming conventions was another challenge. I started with a sense of dislike for the Bootstrap framework, and I still think my choice to learn Flexbox and Grid was right for me. However, I now think I would have benefited from internalising the Bootstrap naming conventions. I am presently learning a bit about BEM, which seems pretty close to Bootstraps class naming conventions.

One of the recurring thoughts throughout the middle part of the process was the wish that I had a better grasp of the mobile-first approach at the start. While I had it clear in my mind when I got to building the site, I was in a rush to make sure my columns were working and that Flexbox wasn't suddenly obsolete. I regretted that as soon as I got to adding media queries. It is so much more elegant, code-wise with Flexbox, when you work from a small device upwards. I could be wrong, I'm new to this, but it does seem that way to me.

I had an hours stab at rewriting the CSS to be properly mobile-first but abandoned it as it felt like an inefficient use of my limited time.

Towards the end, I started using CSS variables, perhaps a bit late in the project for it to be of any great help. Of course, later on, when comes time to adapt the site to something real, it could be greatly helpful.

## Value of the site

**The primary offering** of this site is to share a conviction with a client who believes that social responsibility, entreprenurial spirit and creativity need not be exclusive. There are indeed the Martin Shkrelis of the world, who would avoid our agency like the plague and good riddance. I am reminded of Derek Sivers (CD Baby founder, in his free ebook that he gave when you signed up with CD Baby a million years ago) who said, "Know who it is you want to exclude and commit to their exclusion wholeheartedly". I like that approach, as unfriendly as it initially sounds. It does provide an instant, practical clarity grounded in common sense insight.

This is achieved first of all by the interactive, playful index page, which hints at you to interact right away. This, it is hoped, will keep the Bah Humbugs of the world out, to some extent.

A bulb comes on and there are textual references to "real-world value" (indicating that we aren't into hyping things to sell them dishonestly) and the keywords "transparent" and "ethical" in regards to our end-user. The textual references continue throughout the site in varying amounts.

Visually, the use of white space and contrast are a hint that we might be more "artsy" than the guys who made the drillbit online store you were just looking at. Everybody needs a drillbit once in a while, and its fantastic to have all the options available at once on your screen. However, when you have other goals, you might not want that.

**A secondary offering** of this site is to share a passion for the power of the written word and the image. The right client will be tantalised, titillated and sorely tempted to know what we would do with his or her business. They would have a feeling of, after the long and personal journey with their self image in relation to their work, finally finding a partner they could grow with towards a specific goal. The would have to restrain themselves from coming over to our office and wanting to sit in and take part in every minutae of the process. They would instinctively feel their feedback is welcome and that our clear boundaries are presented in a comfortable and reasonable way.

Again, this is best illustrated by referring to the textual content. While visual elements are very important in giving people a sense of creative promise, I think the emphasis on quality copy plays an important role for the right person.

**Another offering** is a sense of learning and the exchange of ideas.

This is accomplished by having an invitation to a weekly webinar on design and correspondence. I have personally been the beneficiary of lots of online content, and am often astounded at the amount available. Having this as a secondary call-to-action on the main page shows that we value this as a company. It is also sound business sense in 2021 to position oneself as an expert in this way. It attracts and cements client relationships where mutual exchanges can happen, which I think is a very interesting thing as the world gets to grips with the internet.

## Testing procedures

I found this category of remarks counterintuitive, and therefore a good learning experience. Checking the live output of my IDE as I was going seemed the obvious primary testing procedure, but of course I take CI's meaning to be something a bit deeper.

**Asking other people** who's opinion I respect was my primary testing procedure. I have some very talented designers and photographers as good friends, and I did often request their input. I would send them a live link in the early days of Gitpod, and then later on just the Pages link. (I still haven't found a VS extension that replicates what the "python3 -m http.server" command gives you when you make the link public. Very handy!)

My friends were all wonderfully opinionated and clear in their feedback. Mostly they would encourage me to reduce and minimalise. The decision to completely remove the video media, especially, was encouraged by them. I often have an unsure feeling with web design that "more is always needed". My friends helped me be more decisive and committed to my minimalist leaning. Not least my mentor Brian, too.

**Internet Explorer** is awful and I confess I didn't test anything with it by choice. I am new to the world of coding and I don't want to get discouraged, depressed or even infuriated. It does seem like lots of developers have been ignoring it the last few years. I drew some comfort, especially, from the Tasty Syntax podcast episode "Potluck...is Safari the new IE11?..". A bit too deepgeek for me, but it was a relief to hear that many people just ignore IE.

**Chrome and Firefox** on the other hand, were amazing. I am using Visual Studio Code to work in, and the Live Server extension was routed primarily through Firefox. The developer tools in Firefox, if you are using Flexbox, are very helpful. Chrome is working on that functionality, it looks like, but its very much there in Firefox. The Electrophile site was published on Git Pages about halfway through, so I have a Chrome browser tab on all the time that I cross reference once in a while. I may route to Chrome when time comes to use more JavaScript.

**Speaking of VS Code** it has been a lot of fun learning how to use and customise. Although using VS Code, on the surface, doesn't sound like a testing procedure, the steps I went through to integrate it with GitHub made me a lot more aware of how Git works in practise. I ended up simply installing the GitHub desktop app, and that did everything I needed. The long and painful process of getting there, however, taught me what a pull request and a branch merge are. I lost some work in the process, which made me more careful with my commits as well as helped me develop a work flow that kept my eyes on the goal of whatever it was I was trying to accomplish. As obvious as that sounds, you can easily get lost in a rabbithole when you are new to this, I think. At least I easily do.

**The Am I Responsive** website was useful for my own doubts, and it is wonderful that you can actually scroll on each screen. However, this screenshot always makes me laugh because it seems a bit over the top. I do respect the fact that responsiveness is imperative, and has been for some time now. I'm still trying to understand my tickled reaction to this picture. It makes me think of someone selling watches from a raincoat on a streetcorner, a bit lowbrow and flashy.

In all seriousness, its a very handy testing tool and I am glad to have a link to it in my bookmarks bar. Maybe don't knock my grade down if it was your idea...?

## Bugs and challenges

Lots and lots of challenges from the start.

**Positioning** is really the most frustrating and humbling part of working with HTML and CSS. I struggled at the beginning to create columns, then I learned how to do that in a few ways. Once I got ok with that, I struggled to get the content to sit right in those columns. Then I had to really get ideas like flex direction and what the align property really does into my head. Luckily I enjoyed the learning process but it was indeed frustrating. While I disapprove of the action, I do in theory see why CI jumped over Flexbox and Grid to get to...

**Bootstrap**, which did not appeal to me. I didn't like the endless class names cluttering up my HTML, and I didn't like that I didn't know what was happening. It felt like cheating. I can see how someone could get good at it, make nice looking websites and still not really learn CSS properly. I know thats venturing into online troll world, and its not intended as such. Its just how I felt about it, especially combined with feeling it was difficult to understand for me.

**Flexbox and Grid** on the other hand, are marvellous and amazing. I spent more time on Flexbox than on Grid, but I think Grid might be a lot easier. These technologies impress me with the way they anticipate certain needs. Of course, as a new coder, I still get lost with "can I align self this...? Should I change the flex-basis or just add a width..?" but there are times when you really appreciate what Flexbox can do for even little layout applications. The employee quotes, for instance, on the About page, left column, are a great example of this. I could not for the life of me get NAME on the left and PICTURE on the right. I tried all kinds of 'margin-left: auto' and was just going into 'position: absolute' hell when I remembered that I could just group them under a single div and display the pair as flex. Wonderful.

Not to mention the fantastic flex-direction changes you have for responsive modes. Or the way adding the 'flex-wrap: wrap' made my main page just fall right into place with a little bit of 'order: 1' and 'order: 2'.

Its indeed arcane in some sense, but I am enjoying learning it.

**When I did have videos** there was a real bother with getting them to respond. Annoying, ugly YouTube iframes that just sat there, stubborn as a mule. I researched it online, and some thoughtful person had uploaded a precise and concise walkthrough. You can see a link to that in my earlier first_README.md.

**Current issues** In some places Im not 100% sure I like the whitespaces.
