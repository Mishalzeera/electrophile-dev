# **The Electrophile Computational Company**

A website for a fictitious web and app development company. The company has a copywriting and design-first orientation, which is geared towards a clientele with a specific mentality. The client has an entrepreneurial spirit but has an aversion to business-speak-catchphrases. No "implementing strategic deployments using the emerging third world labour market" or indeed, ever using the word "deployment", in any context.

She or he has an innate sense of respect for their customers and, while being ambitious, is not specifically motivated by financial incentives. This is the type of business owner who would run on a sustainable model and the sort of person who - beyond their basic needs and a holiday here and there - isn't out to climb any financial rungs.

Think of [Martin Shkreli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli). Now imagine his total opposite. Our client may indeed have a lot of financial and social clout, and be respected in their field. In any case, he or she would have earned their position through their interpersonal skills and their ability to make the correct judgment of situations and people.

The website is intended to serve as a manifesto of sorts, without being heavy-handed in the way this README is already(!).

I imagine this website to be seen by a potential client after a casual social meeting, probably by chance. "Oh, you make websites and apps?" "Yeah, here let me send you our site." and then upon first glance there is already a sense of connection or not. It's not intended to necessarily draw in people from the web via links but that sort of functionality is present and prominent. A contact page and a few CTA buttons on the main page cater to that situation. The primary client would already have an Electrophile employee's phone number in their mobile, though.

## The evolution of the site

If you refer to first_README.md you can chart my progress more closely. I found it difficult to have any real sense of how to design the site until the company vision, fictitious or not, became clear. It reminded me of my experiences as a freelance audio professional - the most difficult jobs are the ones where the client doesn't know what they want. In the early wireframes, you might get a sense of messing around in the shallow waters. Some of the colour schemes and font ideas did indeed survive, but the intent and purpose have changed totally.

The genesis of the site was in a conversation with my previous mentor. While she was clearly capable and had some good advice for me initially, we had to part ways due to scheduling obstacles and some communication problems. I had initially built a site for my audio services, which I approached in an unorthodox way. I used background images and audio players as the main content. She immediately began picking at issues of contrast and visibility - which were the elements I liked the most. It's a dark, moody website that I want people to spend some time relaxing in. Listen to the music, allow an atmosphere to form.

That is not for everybody and a pretty bad idea for a Code Institute Milestone Project. I can imagine that there are certain concepts you want to be sure that a student grasps - design and structural concepts. Moreover, it being representative of my musical work, I was perhaps too sensitive to any suggestions I didn't like regarding it.

I then thought, why not build a site I can later adapt to my own needs? I have the intention to freelance as a web developer as soon as I am able. A quick Google search of interesting scientific terms yielded the word "electrophile" which I liked.

**First mentor meeting**

Furthermore, at this point, I got in contact with Brian Macharia, my replacement mentor. His feedback was based on objective design principles as well as his experience in mentoring previous CI students. It was, in fact, his off the cuff remark that my ultra-sparse redirect.html page was his favourite that gave me the best sense of how to proceed.

I then really homed in on the bulb image as a central theme for the site. A solitary dark bulb is the index page, and every bulb is a link to the next page.

**Second mentor meeting**

By this point, despite having enjoyed the process of taking the site to its 90% state, I was ready to move on. I had been dabbling in the Javascript and JQuery sections of the CI course and was getting very wrapped up in it. Brian had more good feedback for me, specific points that I could write up in a checklist and get through in a single morning.

## What I learned

There were many stages I particularly enjoyed - working on the images and the text content especially. Web design is easier with strong image, font and content cohesion, I think. Some of the most useful steps in my process involved taking my time choosing the right visual elements.

The areas that I felt the most challenged by were positioning things in CSS, as well as strategising layout and styling decisions to be in harmony with one another.

Redundant class names, poor class naming conventions was another challenge. I started with a sense of dislike for the Bootstrap framework, and I still think my choice to learn Flexbox and Grid was right for me. However, I now think I would have benefited from internalising the Bootstrap naming conventions. I am presently learning a bit about BEM, which seems pretty close to Bootstraps class naming conventions.

One of the recurring thoughts throughout the middle part of the process was the wish that I had a better grasp of the mobile-first approach at the start. While I had it clear in my mind when I got to building the site, I was in a rush to make sure my columns were working and that Flexbox wasn't suddenly obsolete. I regretted that as I got to adding media queries. It is so much more elegant, code-wise with Flexbox when you work from a small device upwards. I could be wrong, I'm new to this, but it does seem that way to me.

I had an hours stab at rewriting the CSS to be properly mobile-first but abandoned it as it felt like an inefficient use of my limited time.

Towards the end, I started using CSS variables, perhaps a bit late in the project for it to be of any great help. Of course, later on, when comes time to adapt the site to something real, it could be greatly helpful.

## Thoughts on CI's HTML and CSS course

I have to admit that I had a very difficult time with much of the Code Institute material. I can see there is some real knowledge and capability in the instructors and I am at a loss to understand why the lessons don't reflect that enough. I relied on other content, some of it paid, to move forwards. Especially considering that I wasn't in favour of using Bootstrap without a grasp of underlying CSS layout technologies, I felt very much on my own.

I leaned heavily on [Kevin Powell's](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) lucid and accessible CSS lessons. Also [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

CI offers outstanding student support and the intelligent, friendly staff I have interacted with have been very encouraging. It is not my intention to disparage the many good things I see CI providing. I hope that a simple update to the didactic content happens soon enough that I may benefit from it, though. Itt is frustrating to now be moving forwards with learning JavaScript, learning from other online resources and using my CI study as a map rather than a central resource.
